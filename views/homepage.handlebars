{{!-- the {{ }} expressions can be used for content as well as attributes --}}

{{!-- two brackets {{ title }} will convert HTML characters to strings; three brackets {{{ body }}} will render the data as HTML --}}

{{!-- handlebars.js has built-in helpers that will allow us to perform minimal logic over an array --}}

<ol class="post-list">
    {{!-- note the use of {{#each}} to begin the loop; any HTML code in between will be repeated for every item in posts; within the {{#each}} block, handlebars.js is smart enough to know that it's working with an object on each iteration so it looks for the necessary properties; we declared a variable name in the {{#each}} expression to make it a little clearer as we use that name for subsequent placeholders --}}
