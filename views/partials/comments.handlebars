{{!-- we can use the trusty keyword this to refer to the parent object or array that's available in the context of the partial; data that's passed to a template file is technically always part of this, but when dealing with objects, we can simply access the object properties directly (e.g., vote_count instead of this.vote_count); because arrays don't have named properties like objects do, we're forced to access the array as this --}}
<div class="comments">
    {{!-- because this is being looped over, all of the expressions within the loop look for properties on each object in this; in this case, that means each comment --}}
  {{#each this}}
